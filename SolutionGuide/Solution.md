# Multi-Agent Systems - Solution Guide

## Introduction

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) consist of multiple autonomous agents, each with distinct goals, behaviors, and areas of responsibility. These agents can interact with each other, either cooperating or competing, depending on the objectives they are designed to achieve. In MAS, each agent operates independently, making decisions based on its local knowledge and the environment, but they can communicate and share information to solve complex problems collectively.

MAS is often used in scenarios where tasks are distributed across different entities, and the overall system benefits from decentralization. Examples include simulations of real-world systems like traffic management, robotic teams, distributed AI applications, or networked systems where agents need to coordinate actions without a central controller. MAS allows for flexibility, scalability, and adaptability in solving dynamic and complex problems where a single agent or centralized system might be less efficient or incapable of handling the complexity on its own.

In this challenge, you will create a multi-agent system that takes the user's request and feeds it to a collection of agents. Each agent will have its own persona and responsibility. The final response will be a collection of answers from all agents that together will satisfy the user's request based on each persona's area of expertise.

## Task 2 - Define Agent Personas and Configure Multi-Agent Chat

1. Open the `multi_agent.py` file. This is where you will implement all necessary code for this challenge.

1. We shall create three **ChatCompletionAgent** personas - Business Analyst, Software Engineer, and Product Owner, each with defined instructions, a unique name, and a Kernel reference. These agents will be linked in an **AgentGroupChat** with an ApprovalTerminationStrategy that terminates the chat when the Product Owner replies with %APPR%.

1. Replace the code in the **multi_agent.py** file with the below mentioned code and save.

1. Click on the ellipses. Select Terminal and choose New Terminal. 

1. // required commands to be added.//

1. Interact with the Multi Agent by giving the below prompt :

   ```
    Build a Calculator App

   ```

1. Wait until the agents interact with themselves and provide a detailed output. Verify the output and differentiate the involvement of different agents in providing the result.   


## Success Criteria

- You have implemented the Multi-Agent Chat system that produces:
  - Software Development Plan and Requirements
  - Source Code in HTML and JavaScript
  - Code Review and Approval

---

## Bonus

- Copy the code from the chat history markdown into matching files on your file system.
- Save HTML content as `index.html` and launch it in your web browser.
- Test if the application functions as the AI described.
- Enhance the app by asking the AI to make it responsive or add new features.
- Experiment with modifying personas to improve results or functionality.

## Conclusion

This challenge demonstrated how to build and coordinate a Multi-Agent System using Azure AI Foundry and Semantic Kernel. By designing distinct personas for Business Analyst, Software Engineer, and Product Owner, and configuring a group chat environment with a termination strategy, you created a collaborative AI workflow capable of gathering requirements, developing code, and performing code reviews. The task structure allows for scalable, decentralized handling of complex problems using autonomous, interactive agents.
